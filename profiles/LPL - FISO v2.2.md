Pressure profile designed to mimic a typical La Pavoni lever machine extraction profile, typically characterized by a high 7-9bar pressure during extraction that gives the shots a uniquely thick mouthfeel and intense flavor.

LPL is La Pavoni for light roasts.
Fast In, Slow Out (FISO) pressure curve to maximize extraction in the early phase of the pull. Slow In, Slow Out (SISO) also exists to target more middle of the shot.

19g dose, 2.3:1 extraction. LPL ratios between 2:1 and 3:1 are viable depending on beans.
