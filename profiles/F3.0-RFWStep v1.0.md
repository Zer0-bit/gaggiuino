Versions of Filter 3.0 that use stop on weight (300g to end up at 365g after all water drains from basket) instead of pure amount pumped. Amount pumped is adjusted (400ml) to provide a safety in case scales do funky.

LF was born because I kept having overflows on some of my beans despite grinding so coarse I lost flavor (probably a grinder issue, j-ultra). It does intensify the flavor some, so you should use RF unless you’ve exhausted other options.

*__This profile requires SCALES!! Use the regular filter3 profiles if you don't have scales.__*
RFW is regular flow (1.5, 1.4, 1.3ml/s), stop on weight
LFW is low flow (1.5, 1.2, 1.1 ml/s), stop on weight
Linear is a linear decrease 
Step is a stepped decrease

Use these with the [Atomique Drip Tray or the regular ultra low profile drip tray](https://www.printables.com/model/1070570-gaggiuino-scales-filter3-atomique-ultra-low-profil).

*__This profile is extremely dependent on the calculated "pump flow", so PZ calibration is important!__*
